# PCI_bus_number_simulation
This is a novel software algorithm used in conjunction with the new Mapping Portal Bridge (MPB) hardware that can be used by system software to enumerate PCI devices under it. This invention disclosure is used to solve the scalability of scarce resources such as Bus, Device, Function (BDF) numbers, and Memory Mapped IO (MMIO).
